# Baby Auth

## Analysis

We are first greeted by a login page. Let's, once again, try `admin` with password `admin`:

```text
Invalid username or password
```

Looks like we'll have to create an account - let's try those credentials.

```text
this user already exists
```

This is great, because now we know we need a user called `admin`. Let's create another user - I'll use username and password `yes`, because I doubt that'll be used.

We're redirected to the login, which makes it seem like it worked. Let's log in with the credentials we just created:

Whoops, guess we're not an admin!

When it comes to accounts, one very common thing to check is **cookies**. Cookies allow, among other things, for users to [authenticate without logging in every time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-authentication-work). To check cookies, we can right-click and hit **Inspect Element** and then move to the **Console** tab and type `document.cookie`.

Well, we have a cookie called `PHPSESSID` and the value `eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InllcyJ9`. Cookies are often base64 encoded, so we'll use a tool called [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it.

Once we decode the base64, we see that the contents are simply `{"username":"yes"}`.

## Exploitation

So, the website knows our identity due to our cookie - but what's to stop us from forging a cookie? Since we control the cookies we send, we can just edit them. Let's create a fake cookie!

Note that we're URL encoding it as it ends in the special character `=`, which usually has to be URL encoded in cookies. Let's change our cookie to `eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIn0%3D`!

Ignore the warning, but we've now set `document.cookie`. Refresh the page to let it send the cookies again.

And there you go - we successfully authenticated as an admin!
